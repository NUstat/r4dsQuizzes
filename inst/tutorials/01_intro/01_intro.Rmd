## Instructions

Complete this tutorial while reading the Preface and Chapter 1 of the [textbook](https://nustat.github.io/intro-stat-data-sci/). Each question allows 3 'free' attempts. After the third attempt a 10% deduction occurs per attempt.

You can click the "View Grade" button as many times as you would like to see your current grade and the number of attempts you are on. Before submitting make sure your grade is as expected.

### Goals

-   Know what resources you have available for help.
-   Understand the basics of R syntax and R output.
-   Understand the functions of important packages.
-   Understand how to find information from a dataframe.


## Exercises

**Exercise 1:**

A code chunk can be used as a calculator. Try typing 2+2 into the code chunk and running the code.

```{r Ex1, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r Ex1-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
2 + 2
```

```{r Ex1-code-check}
grade_this_code()
```

**Exercise 2:**

You can **store** output/results into a variable. Storing output allows you to access the variable later on. When working in Posit, these variables will appear in your **Environment** tab.

Fill in the blanks to store the result of `20*40` into the variable `x`. Note that * is the notation for multiply.

```{r Ex2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.blanks = TRUE}
x ___ 20*___
```

```{r Ex2-hint-1}
The assignment operator is `<-`
```

```{r Ex2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
x <- 20*40
```

```{r Ex2-code-check}
grade_this_code()
```


**Exercise 3:**

A **boolean** statement evaluates to TRUE or FALSE. Type any equation that evaluates to `TRUE`.

```{r Ex3, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r Ex3-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
3 != 2
```

```{r Ex3-check}
grade_this({
  # custom checking code appears here
  if (identical(.result, .solution)) {
    pass("Great work!")
  }
  fail("Try again!")
})
```


**Exercise 4:**

The `mpg` dataset is included in the `ggplot2` package. Print the dataset to answer the following questions. You can "print" output by typing the name of the dataset or variable in a code chunk. Try typing `mpg` in the code chunk and clicking `run`.

```{r Ex4, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r Ex4-Q}
quiz(caption = NULL,
    # Ex4Q1
  question("Ex4Q1) Which of the following are names of variables in the mpg data frame?",
           answer("audi"),
           answer("manufacturer", correct = TRUE),
           answer("dplyr"),
           answer("year", correct = TRUE),
           answer("drv", correct = TRUE),
           answer("glimpse"),
           answer("chr"),
           allow_retry = TRUE,
           random_answer_order = TRUE), 
  # Ex4Q2
  question("Ex4Q2) What's the city miles per gallon for the first observation in the mpg dataframe?",
           answer("29"),
           answer("18", correct = TRUE),
           answer("21"),
           answer("0"),
           answer("NA"),
           answer("4"), 
           allow_retry = TRUE,
           random_answer_order = TRUE) )
